1,Orkney and Shetland English,"Orkney and Shetland, known as ""the Northern Isles"", are the most northerly units of land in the British Isles. The Shetland archipelago has a total area of 1,468 sq. km (compared with Orkney ºs 976 sq. km). In spite of their peripheral location, Orkney and Shetland should not be seen as isolated communities, neither in the past nor today. Shetland now has a population of about 23,000 and Orkney about 20,000. Orkney and Shetland can be characterized as bidialectal speech communities with access to a choice of two discrete, definable forms of speech: one a form of standard, basically Standard Scottish English, and the other a form of traditional dialect. The traditional dialects must be described as varieties of Scots, yet with a substantial component of Scandinavian, manifested above all in the lexicon but also in the phonology and, to a lesser extent, in the grammar. These varieties are often referred to as Insular Scots. Orcadians and Shetlanders are generally aware of commanding two distinct varieties and they have names for these, e.g. English vs. Shetland or Orcadian.",Gunnel Melchers
2,Scottish English,"There is considerable debate about the position and appropriate terminology for the varieties which are spoken in Scotland. Scottish English can be described as a bipolar linguistic continuum, with Broad Scots, essentially a spoken variety, at one end and Scottish Standard English at the other. This continuum is the result of dialect contact and language change over many centuries. Four main dialect divisions of Scots can be distinguished whose names reflect their geographical distribution across Scotland: Mid or Central Scots, Southern or Border Scots, Northern Scots, and Insular Scots. Scots is generally, but not always, spoken by the working classes while Scottish Standard English is typical of educated middle class speakers. It is probably fair to say that a good proportion of the population of Scotland, now estimated at some 5,060,000, are potential speakers of Scottish Standard English. Defining the number of speakers of Scots in Scotland, however, is extremely difficult.",Jennifer Smith
3,Irish English,"The English language was introduced into Ireland with the coming of the Anglo-Normans from West Wales in the late 12th century. Since then the fate of English has been closely linked with that of the Irish language which it came largely to replace in the late modern period. The language shift in Ireland was relatively long, spanning at least three centuries from 1600 to 1900 for most of the country. In present-day Ireland there are only a few small remaining enclaves scattered along the western seaboard where Irish is still spoken as a native language. Linguistically, Ireland is divided into two broad sections, the north and the south. A dividing line can be drawn roughly between Sligo, just south of County Donegal, and Dundalk on the east coast immediately below the border with Northern Ireland.",Markku Filppula
4,Manx English,"Manx Vernacular English may be described as a variety originating as an ethno-regiolect peculiar to the Isle of Man. Today, Manx English is arguably an endangered variety typically spoken by older rural speakers of Manx descent. The variety is characterized by the frequent occurrence of characteristic phonological, lexical and grammatical features, the most elusive yet distinctive of which is intonation. Arguably the most striking of these features testify to the fact that Manx English is the product of a Gaelic language system and various varieties of English. The influx into the Island of non-Manx populations, exogamy, education and work off-Island, as well as the impact of the mass media, have in some ways reduced its use to the well-meaning tokenism of dialect recitations and competitions, particularly of the works of a handful of local vernacular writers such as T E Brown. All members of the local speech community are exposed to Standard English from an early age; some, including political figures, may practise code-switching for ideological reasons linked with nationalism and solidarity, or for humorous effect. Although Manx Vernacular English reflects the influence of Manx Gaelic, the current resurgence of the latter has not noticeably contributed to a comparable revival of Manx English.",Jennifer Kewley Draskau
5,Welsh English,"The longer-standing language of Wales is Welsh, belonging to the Celtic branch of the Indo-European family. The first major incursions of English came in the wake of the Norman invasion of Wales, which began towards the end of the eleventh century AD. Dialects of Welsh English influenced by the south-west of England existed from the twelfth century onwards. Under the Acts of Union of 1536-1543, English was made the sole language of government and law in Wales. Higher prestige and increasing incoming speaker numbers helped establish English as a language of the whole of Wales by the second half of the twentieth century. Regional dialects in particular have had the greatest influence overall on the special character of English in Wales. There are notable differences between the traditional Welsh dialects of north and south Wales. Thus it is possible to talk of two main types of Welsh English, one centred in the north-west, the other in the mid-south. In these main northern and southern sub-varieties, non-standard features tend to be derived from Welsh-language influence. But there are other determining factors, such as influence from the neighbouring non-standard dialects (rural and urban) of England, particularly but not exclusively in the border areas, south Pembrokeshire and Gower.",Robert Penhallurick
6,English dialects in the North of England,"The North of England is a region whose boundaries have been defined in a number of different ways by laypersons, members of the tourist industry and linguists. Dialectologists have attempted to define the North in purely linguistic terms. In this chapter ""the North of England"" is defined as coterminous with that of Anglo-Saxon Northumbria, i.e. stretching from Berwick-upon-Tweed and Carlisle in the North, to Sheffield in the South, and including Merseyside and all of pre-1972 Lancashire (thus also Warrington and Widnes, which are now in Cheshire), and all of Yorkshire and Humberside. As regards northern dialects a frequently uttered concern is that there is an increasing tendency to assimilate the form of the respective dialect with the current English of the schools. It is certainly the case that traditional dialects are being replaced by more modern, urban vernaculars, and that, within certain regions, the dialect of influential towns and cities is spreading. But even where there is clear evidence of levelling in the North, this seems to be in the direction of a regional, or pan-northern, rather than a national model, so that northern dialects can confidently be expected to remain distinctive for some time yet.",Graeme Trousdale
7,English dialects in the Southwest of England,"The Southwest or, to use a more traditional label, the West Country, has figured prominently in dialectological investigations for centuries. From a modern viewpoint, one can only guess at the reasons behind the considerable attention that has been attributed to West Country English, particularly in the 19th century. One of the major factors causing interest in the region certainly was its rural character and relative remoteness, which to a certain extent still survives to the present day. Traditionally, attributes such as ""rustic"" or ""primitive"" were associated with inhabitants of the West Country and their speech patterns. For the sake of simplicity, ""the West Country"" or ""the Southwest"" will be considered as a homogeneous linguistic area here. The core of this area is constituted by the counties of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, and Wiltshire, while its boundaries are formed by the parts of the adjoining counties of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Worcestershire, and Herefordshire, which create a transition zone. Hampshire and Berkshire are not included; Berkshire is not often covered in studies of the Southwest, due to its ""transitional nature"", while Hampshire shows a high degree of mixture of features from the Southwest.",Susanne Wagner
8,East Anglian English,"As a modern topographical and cultural term, East Anglia refers to an area with no official status. Most people would agree that the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk are prototypically East Anglian. Historically, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of East Anglia at its greatest extent consisted of the habitable parts of Norfolk and Suffolk plus eastern Cambridgeshire. East Anglian English has probably always been a distinctive area. East Anglia has a serious claim to be the first place in the world where English was ever spoken. Subsequently, East Anglian English played an important role in the formation of Standard English, in the development of colonial Englishes, notably the American English of New England and also formed part of the input for the formation of the Englishes of Australia and New Zealand. More recently, however, East Anglia, particularly the northern area, has become much more isolated, and its English has retained a number of conservative features. Modern linguistic East Anglia consists of a core area (Norfolk and Suffolk, except for the Fenland areas of western Norfolk and northwestern Suffolk, plus northeastern Essex) together with surrounding transition zones (Norfolk and Suffolk Fens, together with eastern Cambridgeshire, central Essex, and a small area of NE Hertfordshire).",Peter Trudgill
9,English dialects in the Southeast of England,"The southeast of England is a relatively young dialect area in classificatory terms. A large area of what is now part of the Southeast - especially the counties directly south of London: Surrey, Sussex, but even Kent - used to belong to the Southwest linguistically. Former general Southern features seem to have receded to the Southwest proper quite rapidly at least since the end of the nineteenth century. Today, the Southeast of England is clearly dominated - and influenced - by the metropolis London. Based on Trudgill‚Äôs modern dialect areas, the Southeast includes, for the purpose of this chapter, the metropolis itself and the Home Counties, i.e. those counties neighbouring on London: Middlesex, Essex (where it doesn‚Äôt belong to East Anglia), Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire (where they do not belong to the South Midlands), Berkshire, Hampshire (where they do not belong the Southwest), Surrey, Sussex and Kent.",Lieselotte Anderwald
10,Channel Islands English,"The Channel Islands (Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney and Sark) are regarded as a French-speaking area in traditional dialectology because the original language on the islands is a form of Norman French that has been spoken there for centuries. But over the last 200 years, English has gained more and more influence and is the dominant language on the islands today. It has gradually replaced the local Norman French dialects, which will most certainly not survive as a living language. Channel Island English is characterised by a unique blend of features originating from different sources. On the one hand, there are non-standard features of British English that have arrived in the Channel Islands as a result of the close connections with Britain and because of the many British immigrants. On the other hand, Channel Island English comprises features that have their origin in Channel Island French.",Anna Rosen
11,British Creole,"British Creole is spoken by British born people of Caribbean background whose parents, grandparents or great grandparents have migrated to Britain since 1948. It is an ethnic variety, rather than a regional or local one. British Creole is the product of dialect contact between West Indian migrants, the largest group of whom were Jamaican during the period of critical formation (1950-1970), and vernacular varieties of urban English English. Because of the Jamaican input, most apparent at the lexical and grammatical level, British Creole has been described as a collection of local British varieties of Jamaican Creole. Speakers of British Creole (who usually call the language Patois or Patwa), from the second generation onwards, are all bilinguals or multilinguals. At a very early age, they acquire a local variety of British English; at school if not earlier, they will be exposed to Standard English as well. In the second and later generations, code switching in private conversations is common, with local English English predominating over Creole. Although grammatical, phonological and lexical evidence indicates clearly that British Creole is based on Jamaican Creole, its speakers are not confined to the descendents of Jamaicans.",Mark Sebba
12,Maltese English,"Maltese English (‚ÄúMaltE‚Äù) is a postcolonial English variety spoken on the Mediterranean island-nation of Malta by Maltese-English bilinguals.  According to the 2005 census, English is spoken by 318,354 Maltese residents, or 87.9% of the population; Maltese is reported as being spoken by 97.9% of the population.  MaltE is acquired as an L1 and L2, both simultaneously with Semitic Maltese and sequentially. While the majority of people acquire MaltE largely outside the home as an early L2, MaltE is also acquired at home as an L1 by a minority of speakers residing largely in the Northern Valletta Harbour region.  MaltE is the main language in independent and church schools and at the University of Malta, yet there is good evidence of high-levels of codeswitching in teacher-pupil discourse (Camilleri 1995). Both languages are used in the workplace to varying degrees.  MaltE exhibits deviations from British and American varieties at all levels of linguistic structure, it displays structural regularity conditioned by linguistic, social, and stylistic factors, and shows influence from Maltese and Italian.",Lisa Bonnici and Michaela Hilbert and Manfred Krug
13,Newfoundland English,"Newfoundland was one of the earliest British-settled areas of the New World, with continuous settlement from the beginning of the 17th century. Until the 20th century, settlers in Newfoundland were drawn almost exclusively from two principal geographical sources, the southwest counties of England and the southeast counties of Ireland. From a linguistic perspective, geographical, socioeconomic and demographic factors have had a conservative effect. At present, there is a considerable range of dialect diversity within Newfoundland, which correlates with both social and regional factors, as well as speech register.",Sandra Clarke
14,Colloquial American English,"Colloquial English constructions fall into two categories: those that are socially and stylistically diagnostic but have no regional affiliation, and those that are regionally restricted but usually not diagnostic socially or stylistically. Features in the first category are typically recognized as vernacular, so they attract the attention of English teachers, prescriptive dictionary editors, and other language watchers concerned about the health and vitality of the language. Features in the second category, however, may either occur so transparently that they go unnoticed until attention is drawn to them, or be widely recognized as dialectal stereotypes.",Beth Lee Simon
15,Urban African American Vernacular English,"Urban varieties of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) are spoken by more than 30 million working-class African Americans throughout North America, with heavy concentrations of speakers in metropolitan areas such as New York, Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Chicago, Detroit, Houston, and Los Angeles. These cities account for well over half of urban AAVE speakers. Many of these residents migrated from rural areas of the South during the Great Migration from 1910 through 1930, and some of these urban African American communities remain among the most de facto segregated regions in the United States. In these segregated urban contexts, many of the contemporary features of AAVE were developed or intensified during the twentieth century, setting these varieties further apart from cohort, working-class white metropolitan communities. In Northern urban areas, AAVE is less likely to show accommodation to regional dialects than in the South. In more recent decades, a trend of Southern back-migration has taken place, in which cities of the Southern United States such as Atlanta, Charlotte, and Memphis have become prominent contemporary sites for the use of urban AAVE. In some respects, the distinction between urban and rural AAVE overshadows straightforward regional dialects in marking varieties of AAVE.",Walt Wolfram
16,Rural African American Vernacular English,"Varieties of rural, or ‚Äúnon-metro‚Äù African American Vernacular English (AAVE), are spoken by several million working-class African Americans living in small, more-geographically remote communities in the Southern United States, though there are some representative rural African American communities in the Northern United States and in Canada. More than 70 percent of these residents are concentrated in the Southern states of Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana. Rural Southern AAVE varieties served as the foundation for the development of current-day AAVE, thus providing an important sociohistorical and sociolinguistic context for examining the earlier status of AAVE as a socioethnic variety. Some small, rural Black Southern communities have been continuously maintained for up to three centuries, transitioning from earlier slave and sharecropping communities into predominantly African American, independent communities. For many structural linguistic features, Southern rural varieties of AAVE are more closely aligned with their regional working-class white Southern dialects than their metropolitan counterparts. At the same time, rural African American varieties typically maintain a distinctive base of socioethnic dialect traits that differentiates them from white cohort dialect communities.",Walt Wolfram
17,Earlier African American Vernacular English,"For decades American sociolinguists have debated the origins of AAVE. While earlier views tended to believe in a prior creole stage, more recent scholarship increasingly accepts the assumption that many features of AAVE go back to English dialect roots. What is responsible for the extent to which slaves learned approximations of white dialects or restructured the English they used is likely to depend on the nature of the contact between the black and white population. Regional differences in and temporal change of settlement patterns, demographics, and economics of the US South suggest varying conditions for the slaves‚Äô language acquisition within the former colonial area of the US South.",Alexander Kautzsch
18,Ozark English,"Ozark English is a rural, working-class variety spoken in the highlands of northwestern Arkansas and in neighboring parts of southwestern Missouri.  The region was first settled in the 1830s by migrants from the Upper South/South Midland, especially from the states of Kentucky and Tennessee; therefore, it is no surprise that Ozark English shares a number of features with dialects in the Upper South, and especially with Appalachian English.  The Ozark region experienced a net loss of population between 1900 and 1940, and this loss of population, coupled with the region‚Äôs relative physical and cultural isolation, contributed to Ozark English being something of a ‚Äúrelic‚Äù variety.  Since the 1940s, the region has seen a significant growth in population, and the increase in population from outside the region may well, over time, diminish the status of Ozark English as a distinct regional variety.",Michael Ellis
19,Appalachian English,"The first European settlers of Appalachia, a mainly mountainous region of the eastern United States, arrived in the 1730s and were mostly of Scotch-Irish or German origin. Until recently travel in or across the region has often been difficult and many smaller communities have been physically remote from centres of population. The isolated character of the entire area has, however, been greatly overstated. Because of its varied history, its large expanse, and its loose borders, Appalachia represents neither a distinct nor a unified speech region. Several sub-regional varieties were the result of settlement by different groups. The broadest geographical definition of the region is from central New York southwest to northeastern Mississippi, with a population of 23 million.",Michael Montgomery
20,Southeast American enclave dialects,"The dialectal complexity of the American South should not be underestimated. A history of demographic upheavals has produced a complicated web of ethnic, regional, social, and generational variation, as well as relic areas, current focal areas, and former focal areas. Noteworthy enclave dialects in North Carolina, produced by centuries of relative isolation, have been the focus of much recent research. These include the dialects spoken on the island of Ocracoke, in coastal Hyde County, and by the Lumbee Indians.",Walt Wolfram
21,Gullah,"Gullah is spoken primarily along the coasts of South Carolina and Georgia. It probably emerged through a process of language contact between African and English varieties spoken during the Atlantic slave-trading era. During this time, African slaves, speaking a variety of mutually non-intelligible languages, would have had an urgent need to communicate with one another and those that enslaved them. In response to this need, they are believed to have formed contact varieties which drew upon the English vocabulary of the British slave traders and plantation owners, while retaining phonological and grammatical features from their own West African languages.",Salikoko Mufwene
22,Chicano English,"ChcE is a native variety of English that has been influenced by its Mexican Spanish substrate. Speakers of this ethnic dialect enact their social practices with Chicano English, in conjunction with Chicano Spanish and in some cases other varieties of Spanish and English as well. The hostility that ChcE arouses is consistent with the general public ºs disapproval of other U.S. ethnic dialects, such as African American Vernacular English, whose communities seem to resist the national hegemony of English monolingualism and Standard English.",Robert Bayley
23,Bahamian English,"The Bahamas consist of more than 700 islands and over 5,000 square miles of land mass. The 30 inhabited islands contain almost 300,000 permanent residents, two-thirds of whom now live in the urban area of Nassau. Many of the Afro-Bahamians, who comprise 85 percent of the population, came from the Gullah-speaking areas of South Carolina and Georgia and many of the original Anglo-Bahamian settlers were British loyalists from North America who came to the Bahamas from the US after the Revolutionary War.",Jeffrey Reaser and Benjamin Torbert
24,Bahamian Creole,"Bahamian Creole (locally termed ""dialect"") is spoken by ca. 250,000 speakers in The Commonwealth of The Bahamas, an archipelago of over 700 islands extending between Florida and Hispaniola. The country is heavily urbanized, with about two thirds of all Bahamians living in the capital, Nassau. Economically, it depends on the service-oriented tourism and banking industries. The creole spoken in the Bahamas today was imported by loyalist blacks in the wake of the American Revolutionary War; it may be regarded as a diaspora variety of Gullah. The majority of Bahamians today speak a mesolectal form of Bahamian Creole. Basilectal speakers tend to be elderly Bahamians and/or those who live on the more remote islands, especially in the southeast. As in most other post-colonial speech communities, negative attitudes towards the vernacular prevail. Since independence in 1973, Bahamian Creole has received a boost as a symbol of national identity. Nevertheless, the role of standard English as the sole official language of the country is uncontested.",Stephanie Hackert
25,Barbadian Creole (Bajan),"Barbados is a contemporary nation state that won its independence from Britain in 1966. While the official language of this country is English, the population also speaks an English related Creole, Bajan, arising from a particular language contact situation of slavery and bonded servitude, under British colonization. Bajan is unique amongst languages in the Anglophone Caribbean territories, because its creole affiliations have been questioned.",Korah Belgrave and Stacy Denny
26,Jamaican English,"Jamaican English, or Standard Jamaican English, is the variety of English spoken by more than 2 mio speakers of English in Jamaica. It is the official language of Jamaica, recognised by the constitution, and used in all official domains. Jamaican English developed parallel to Jamaican Creole after the British had taken over the island from the Spanish in 1655 as the colony‚Äôs economy was mainly based on large sugar plantations which relied on slaves from West Africa as their labour force. Due to the continued coexistence of Jamaican Creole and English, a linguistic continuum has developed, which ranges between a broad or basilectal variety of Jamaican Creole to an acrolectal variety of Jamaican English. Before Jamaica reached its political independence from Britain in 1962, the most acrolectal variety had been a standard form of British English. More recently, this exogenous standard has been replaced with an emerging regional standard variety, as can be seen in studies such as Sand (1999) on morpho-syntactic and lexical features or Irvine (2008)  on the pronunciation of Jamaican English.",Andrea Sand
27,Jamaican Creole,"The popular perception within Jamaica of the Jamaican language situation is that it consists of two varieties: Jamaican Creole, popularly labeled  ºPatwa º and Jamaican English. Historically, JamC phonology represents the output of speakers of West African languages modifying the phonological shape of words coming into their speech from varieties of 17th century British English. JamE in contemporary Jamaica is the Caribbean-accented standard variety used in formal and public contexts.",Peter Patrick
28,San Andr√©s Creole,"San Andres-Old Providence Creole English is spoken by 20,000 - 30,000 ethnic Creoles in the Archipelago of San Andres, Old Providence and Santa Catalina, Colombia, located 180 kms off the Nicaraguan Coast as well as by emigrants on the Colombian mainland, the Caribbean Coast of Central America, and the United States. It is unclear to what extent the differences between the insular varieties (and even within more densely populated San Andres) are diatopic and not due to variation in terms of the creole continuum model. The key factor seems to be the relative basilectality of certain San Andres varieties vis-√†-vis the acrolectality of Providence Creole English. The same applies to closely related Nicaraguan Creole English, which is mesolectal with regard to the cited creoles. Especially San Andres Creole English is first and foremost an off-shoot of Jamaican Creole as the foundations of the present-day population were laid around 1730 with the arrival of colonists (and slaves) from other parts of the British Caribbean, especially Jamaica, and directly from the British Isles (above all from Scotland and Ireland) and West Africa. The creole must have jelled during the second half of the 18th century. Both San Andr√©s and Providencia Creole English have contributed to the development of Central American English Creoles from the early 19th century onwards. The variety described in the survey is basilectal San Andres Creole.",Angela Bartens
29,Belizean Creole,"The Central American region has been subjected to multiethnic and multilingual influences over the last centuries, starting with Spanish rule in the 15th and 16th century. The location of English speakers in Central America reflects the tumultuous conflicts that opposed Spain and England between the 17th and the 19th centuries, as well as some later traces of labor immigration. All English-speaking regions are located on the Caribbean coast of Central America, and except for Belize, they are all part of overwhelmingly Spanish-speaking republics. In multiethnic Belize, an English-based creole is the mother tongue for some groups and a widely-used lingua franca and second language for most others.",Genevi√®ve Escure
30,Guyanese Creole (Creolese),"Guyanese Creole, more commonly referred to by its native speakers as Creolese, is the mother tongue of the majority of the over 700, 000 inhabitants of the Republic of Guyana on the north-east shoulder of South America. It is a widely-used vernacular language variety which co-exists with Standard Guaynese English, the sole official language, which is normally acquired through formal schooling. Additionally, it is spoken by several hundred thousand other Guyanese, who live in the diaspora communities worldwide. This language variety has a high degree of variability, primarily caused by ongoing contact with its major contributing lexifier, English. Other contributing languages include Arawak (Lokono), Carib (Karina), Bhojpuri, Akan, Kikongo, Yoruba and Dutch. Linguists such as Bickerton (1975) and Rickford (1987) have previously described this language variety as existing on a continuum which has conservative or basilectal Guyanese Creole on one end and acrolectal Standard Guyanese English on the other end.",Hubert Devonish and Dahlia Thompson
31,Eastern Maroon Creole,"The term Eastern Maroon Creole or Nenge(e) is a cover term for three very closely related and mutually intelligible conservative Creole varieties spoken by the descendants of three Maroon groups (Aluku, Ndyuka or Okanisi, Pamaka) in Suriname and French Guiana. Speakers of these languages predominantly reside in rural and urban centres of the two countries, but also in Europe (Netherlands, France). Their speaker numbers are not fully known. Conservative counts estimate that they number roughly between 65.000 and 80.000 speakers in total. These communities and languages emerged throughout the 18th century as a result of their founders‚Äô flight from the plantations of Suriname. These languages are still widely used as home and community languages and in recent years have made some head way in the public sphere in both countries. They used to be very much stigmatized but attitudes towards them have significantly improved due to various social changes in the region.",Bettina Migge
32,Saramaccan,"Saramaccan, spoken in Suriname and French Guyana like Sranan, is a maroon language. It is largely used by the descendants of slaves who escaped from the Jewish-owned plantations on the middle Suriname River. The Jewish population had probably arrived indirectly from Brazil and had brought Portuguese-speaking slaves with them who influenced the local Sranan. This gave rise to a new creole language, the precursor of Saramaccan. Just like the other Surinamese creoles it is often considered a ‚Äòradical‚Äô creole because of its considerable divergence from English. It used to be spoken in semi-autonomous communities founded by escaped slaves in the early to mid 18th century.",Tonjes Veenstra
33,Sranan,"Sranan is one of the English-lexifier creole languages spoken in Suriname and French Guyana. No kind of popular or colonial English is known which could fulfil the role of overall direct precursor to these languages. The first English settlers came to Suriname in 1651, but the vast majority of them had already left the country again in 1675. The first records of Sranan are from 1707. The language diverges to a considerable extent from English and is often referred to as a ‚Äòradical‚Äô creole. Sranan used to be the language of the coastal plantations and of the capital, Paramaribo. Today it is used both as a first language and as a lingua franca throughout the country.",Donald Winford
34,Trinidadian Creole,"The history of conquest, exploitation and migration was different for Trinidad and Tobago, notwithstanding their common Amerindian indigenous base and initial Spanish incursions. Both were claimed by Columbus in 1498, but Tobago was sighted and not invaded at this time. However, Trinidad remained Spanish until 1797, with a strong French presence up to the late-eighteenth century, while Tobago was continuously squabbled over until 1763, but with no lasting linguistic impact either from Spanish or French. Today the two islands share a mesolectal English-lexicon creole, which is alike in most particulars; in addition, a basilectal variety characterizes Tobagonian speech.",Dagmar Deuber and Valerie Youssef
35,Vincentian Creole,"Vincentian creole (VinC) is spoken by natives and residents of St Vincent and the Grenadines, a plural nation located in the southern end of the Caribbean archipelago. Although other varieties of English, ranging from standard Vincentian to a basilectal variety coexist on the islands, locals tend to resort to varieties closer to the basilect in everyday interactions. However, despite its prevalence, for a wide host of Vincentians, Vincentian parlance is broken English or a dialect. In recent years, given the increasing linguistic attention that other varieties of English in the Caribbean region have been attracting, the perception of Vincentian as a bastard language has been changing and the domains of use have increased considerably. VinC is itself, a relatively young language, not more than 300 years old. Indeed, its presence on St Vincent and the Grenadines seems to coincide with the establishment of full scale plantation slavery towards the second half of the eighteenth century.",Paula Prescod
36,Krio (Sierra Leone Creole),"Krio, the lingua franca of Sierra Leone (estimated 5.5 Million population), is used natively by approximately 400,000 speakers living primarily in Freetown and surrounding villages though over 4 Million non-native speakers use it proficiently in various domains of communication daily. Krio emerged from creole varieties used primarily by formerly enslaved groups resettled in Freetown and its environs between 1787 and 1850:  Black Poor (England); Nova Scotians; Jamaican Maroons; and Recaptives (would-be slaves from ships intercepted by British fleet along the West African coast). Krio is embraced as a symbol of Sierra Leone identity though sometimes disparagingly referred to as ‚Äòbroken English‚Äô. More positive attitudes have resulted in its widespread use in social, political, and educational contexts. Krio grammar has recently been influenced by input from non-native speakers who were displaced from other parts of Sierra Leone by the 1990s civil war and resettled in Freetown, resulting in the incorporation of non-native grammatical forms into Krio. As a result, Krio has developed variant forms where formerly there was no variation. Some native Krio speakers, accepting change as inevitable, have incorporated the variant forms into their grammar; others have criticized and rejected them in an effort to maintain the ‚Äúpurity‚Äù of the language.",Malcolm Finney
37,Liberian Settler English,"English is Liberia ºs official language. There is a Liberian variety of Standard English; it is the language of Liberia ºs media and institutions of higher learning, and it is the target of language instruction in Liberian schools. Liberian Settler English is the language of the Settler ethnic group, i.e. descendants of the 16,000 African Americans who immigrated to Liberia in the nineteenth century after the abolition of slavery in the Americas and the Caribbean. It is a direct descendant of the nineteenth-century African American English that the immigrants brought with them.",John Singler
38,Vernacular Liberian English,Vernacular Liberian English is the language of most English-speaking Liberians today. First references to the Pidgin go back as far as the beginning of the 18th century. Troops and labourers at a major rubber plantation brought their language with them as the Liberian government reached out from the coastal areas and took control of the interior of the country. VLibE had at first been a local variety of the pidginized English of the West African coast more generally but was strongly influenced by Liberian Settler English as soon as the first settlers arrived in the 1820s. For this reason it now sharply diverges from Pidgin English in the rest of West Africa.,John Singler
39,Ghanaian English,"Ghana is a coastal West African country with a population of 19 million. The number of English speakers has increased steadily from a mere fifth of Ghanaians aged 15+ in 1962 to two thirds at the turn of the millennium, but its quality varies widely, from native-like fluency to broken varieties. There is yet no substantial native speaker community of English. Owing to its colonial past, GhE is oriented towards BrE.",Magnus Huber
40,Ghanaian Pidgin,"Ghanaian Pidgin English is a predominantly urban phenomenon, confined to a smaller section of society than Pidgin in other anglophone West African countries. Also, its functional domain is more restricted and the language is more stigmatized. There are two varieties of GhP. Uneducated GhP is used in highly multilingual contexts, whereas the more educated varieties are better characterized as in-group languages whose main function is to express group solidarity. GhP enjoys covert prestige among educated adult males in urban, informal, and unmonitored settings, but in formal and traditional situations Pidgin is felt to be inadequate, rude, or disrespectful and a Ghanaian language or Standard English is preferred.",Magnus Huber
41,Nigerian English,"English was introduced in Nigeria with the establishment of British trading contacts on the West African coast in the sixteenth century and began to be formally studied from the middle of the nineteenth century on. In the 1880s, the missionary stations were ordered to teach English in their schools to Africans who would serve British colonial and trade interests. In Nigerian education today, English plays a key role. There is no uniform accent of English spoken throughout Nigeria. Nigerian English is usually divided into several sub-varieties, with a continuum of degrees of competence in English as a typical characteristic of a country where English functions as a second language.",Rotimi Taiwo
42,Nigerian Pidgin,"Nigerian Pidgin is the product of contact between English and Nigerian languages. However, the first European visitors to the coast of Nigeria were not the English but the Portuguese. A kind of pidgin Portuguese probably developed between the Portuguese and their Nigerian hosts, later to be replaced by an English-based Nigerian Pidgin which is widely used nowadays. Today, several sub-varieties of Nigerian Pidgin can be recognised. Nigerian Pidgin has no official status even though the Government and its agents now use it as a means of reaching a wider audience.",Nicholas Faraclas
43,Cameroon English,"Cameroon English (CamE) is the English of the educated Anglophone Cameroonian. Despite some predictable ethnic and educational variations, CamE is fairly homogeneous, due partly to the relatively small size of the Anglophone population on which it is basically modelled; the two Anglophone provinces cover 9% of the national territory, and have about three million inhabitants, which represents about 20% of the country ºs population. Its norm orientation is towards British English, although the accent is clearly West African.",Augustin Simo Bobda
44,Cameroon Pidgin,"From a fairly marginal language that grew out of contacts between Europeans and the coastal inhabitants of Cameroon some three hundred years ago, Kamtok has developed into a fully-fledged language and is put to a wide range of uses. A survey of urban centres revealed that in the English-speaking part of the country up to 97% of school-age children already use Kamtok at the time they enter school. Kamtok is used in science and technology, in urban mass or popular culture and religion. Users bring into their Kamtok idiolects various features that derive from the official and indigenous languages that they use in different circumstances.",Anne Schr√∂der
45,Tanzanian English,"Tanzania was only colonised in the last decades of the 19th century. The Germans as first colonisers did not establish their own language in the colony, however, but rather used the language of the coastal towns, Kiswahili, as a lingua franca also for the inland territory. When the British took over the colony after Word War I, they essentially kept this system. Kiswahili continued to be used in ethnically mixed centres and English was reserved for the highest functions in administration, law and education. The expansion of English down the social hierarchy began mainly at the end of colonial rule but Tanzania also made great progress towards expanding the functions of Kiswahili at the expense of English. TznE shows the characteristic features of New Englishes and has about 2 million speakers (5% of the population) today.",Josef Schmied
46,Kenyan English,"The Kenyan English described here is a post-colonial second language variety spoken by Black Kenyans. It co-exists with minority native English varieties spoken by White and Asian Kenyans. It is surrounded by around forty indigenous languages, among which Swahili, representing the tribes of Kenya. But Swahili, unlike the others, has always enjoyed the constitutional status of the national language of Kenya and, from August 2010, that of official language besides English. While both Swahili and English serve as lingua francas, the latter is more widely spoken because it has always been the official medium of instruction from class 1 of primary school (except where indigenous languages are dominant) while Swahili is only taught as a subject. English enjoys high prestige among educated Kenyans, especially in Nairobi, where it is acquired as an L1 in a non-negligible number of wealthy families. Kenyan English is characterized by distinctive linguistic features used nationally and those, essentially phonological, used regionally and identifiable from accents influenced by local indigenous languages.",Alfred Buregeya
47,Ugandan English,"Ugandan English is influenced by the different indigenous languages in Uganda and to a great extend by Luganda, the most widely spoken language in the country. In their early contact with the British, the Baganda demanded the official use of English for local and intra-territorial communication in the country. The British colonial government introduced English as a subject in primary schools and it became a language of instruction in secondary schools and other higher levels of education. At independence, Uganda had a considerable number of English speakers, who spoke the language almost without an accent. However, the political instability in 1970s and 1980s was not only marked by the expulsion of foreigners, the majority of whom were native speakers of English, but also the killing of Ugandans who had become fluent English speakers. However, notwithstanding the political instability, all postcolonial governments maintained the status of English as the only official language of country. It is the main language of education, government, commerce, and judiciary. In Kampala, the capital city of the country, its use as the language of the media and entertainment is now very significant.",Jude Ssempuuma
48,White Zimbabwean English,"Although spoken by just 5% of the population, English has status dominance and is the official language in Zimbabwe. It thrives in a complex set of multilingual and multiethnic environments: the numerically dominant language is Shona (75% of the population), followed by a number of minority languages. WhZmE is the L1 variety spoken mainly by descendants of European, principally British and British South African settlers in Zimbabwe. It is grouped with the other southern hemisphere L1 varieties of English descended from British input dialects transported in the course of the 19th century. Since independence in 1980, it has become an expression of national and ideological identity ‚Äì especially for the 5 million members of the expatriate community ‚Äì and is today a productive and changing variety.",Susan Fitzmaurice
49,Black South African English,"Whereas the segregative and oppressive practices of apartheid had led to the development of a relatively homogenous second language variety, BlSAfE is today becoming slightly more diffuse. This reflects a new diversity of lifestyles, and educational and cultural mixing. English is not only the main language of a multilingual Black elite, but is even making inroads into some homes. For some children English has become their first language. Like elsewhere, an indigenised (or nativised) form of English is likely to develop.",Rajend Mesthrie
50,Indian South African English,"The existence of Indian languages in South Africa is a consequence of the abolition of slavery in the colonies, when Asian migrant labour filled the gap caused by the emigration of freed slaves. The sociolinguistic milieu in which Indians found themselves was particularly complex: Not only did they lack a knowledge of English and Zulu, but they would not always have been able to converse amongst themselves. Under these circumstances a pidgin English might have arisen; the kind of English that stabilized was a very special one, given that the policy of apartheid kept Indian children away from first-language speakers of English descent.",Rajend Mesthrie
51,White South African English,"The term  ºWhite South African English º is applied to the first language varieties of English spoken by White South Africans, with the L1 English varieties spoken by Zimbabweans and Namibians, mainly of British descent, being recognised as offshoots. There is some social and regional variation within the variety. Social variation can be classified into three groupings: Cultivated, closely approximating RP and associated with upper class; General, a social indicator of the middle class, and Broad, associated with working class and/or Afrikaans descent, and closely approximating the second-language Afrikaans English variety.",Sean Bowerman
52,Indian English,"Indian English (IndE) is a cover term for a number of varieties of English as a second language in India. These varieties exhibit significant phonological variations, stemming from regional linguistic differences. However many of these features converge into what can be considered a  ºgeneral º phonology of IndE. English is widely used in India - it is the  ºassociate official º language of the country and it also serves as a link language between the educated. It is the most potent medium of higher education, perhaps the sole medium of science and technology. Most books, newspapers, reports, seminars and so forth directed to a nationwide audience are brought out in this language.",Devyani Sharma
53,Pakistani English,"English was first introduced in the Indo-Pak subcontinent by the British in the 16th century. By 1947, when Pakistan and India gained their independence, English had become so entrenched in the socio-political fabric of the region that it was retained as an official language in both countries. PakE is heterogeneous not only because of the socio-economic, geographic, and educational background of the people who speak it, but also because of the various first languages of its speakers.",Ahmar Mahboob
54,Butler English,"Butler English is a pidgin spoken in India. Despite its name, ButlE is not restricted to any occupation or region, though it is restricted to a certain class. It has its roots in the hierarchical relation of the dominant and the dominated. The label pidgin for ButlE has therefore been questioned and alternative labels like  ºsemi-pidgin º or  ºminimal pidgin º have been suggested. ButlE oscillates between a pidgin and an early fossilised interlanguage. ButlE is spoken by generally uneducated bilinguals knowing some English, such as guides showing foreign visitors around, market women selling wares to foreigners frequenting Indian markets, domestic staff of hotels, catering to tourists and upper-class Indians, domestic staff of prestigious clubs and other recreation centres, and domestic staff employed in racially mixed or westernised Indian households. And it is spoken in a very restricted set of domains: the domestic work-sphere domain, fixed locales like those of hotels, clubs and households, during fixed working hours to indicate the role-relationship of master and servant and to discuss limited topics.",Priya Hosali
55,Sri Lankan English,"Sri Lankan English (SLE) belongs to the family of South Asian Englishes. English is the third language of Sri Lanka after Sinhala and Tamil, and is spoken as a first language by a small but significant minority of the population ‚Äì significant not so much for their numbers, but because they tend to belong to the Colombo elite, and therefore to be prominent in the social, political, commercial and cultural life of the country. The variety of English spoken by this group is generally referred to as Standard Sri Lankan English, and it remains close to the British standard from which it originated during colonial times. A number of non-standard varieties are spoken by others with varying degrees of bilingualism in English and Sinhala or Tamil.",Michael Meyler
56,Hong Kong English,"Hong Kong English is the variety of English spoken as a second language by 187,281 people (quoted from the latest population by-census in 2006) in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Hong Kong is basically a monoethnic society with over 95 percent of its total population being Chinese. Cantonese is spoken as a first language and has long been viewed as the language of solidarity and community ties. However, the use of English is increasingly common in certain socially conditioned contexts from the 1980s and 1990s onwards. There are a large number of Filipino domestic helpers in Hong Kong, who speak English with their employers, which makes it necessary to use English in the home. In fact, the 2006 By-Census shows that the percentage of the population claiming to speak English as either their usual language or as an additional language rose from 38.1% in 1996, to 43% in 2001, to 44.7% in 2006. Now that English is being increasingly put in contact with the languages of the indigenous populations in domestic environments, it appears true enough to suggest that Hong Kong English is a variety with its own norms and its own local speech community.",May L-Y Wong
57,Colloquial Singapore English (Singlish),"Colloquial Singaporean English (Singlish) is a postcolonial Southeast Asian variety of English spoken in the densely populated city-state of Singapore. The linguistic ecology of Singlish is characterised by extensive contact situations. Its speakers, the ethnically mixed resident population, count close to 4 million and mainly consist of Chinese, Malays and Indians. English is the ethnically neutral of the four official languages and used as the national lingua franca. It is taught as a first language by teachers commonly using the indigenised form in the classroom. Literacy in English and its use as a domestic language have risen significantly in the last decades;  Singaporeans increasingly consider themselves native speakers of the local variety and command a range of stylistic variants. Although Singlish is challenged by the government ºs language policy, it is valued by its speakers as an expression of a distinct Singaporean identity.",Lisa Lim and Umberto Ansaldo
58,Malaysian English,"Beginning with the establishment of a colony in Penang in 1786, English became firmly established in the ""Straits Settlement"" in the nineteenth century and thereafter, though after Malaysia ºs independence in 1957 a national language policy reduced the role of the language in the country. The variety known as Malaysian English owes much to its co-existence with other local languages. Several indigenised sub-varieties of MalE can be identified at the informal level, depending on the L1. These sub-varieties co-exist with a more codified and standardised model variety. In some aspects this tendency is slowly being changed, with some of the informal features also appearing in rhetorical and official discourse and a mesolectal form of Malaysian English being increasingly adopted as a local identity marker.",Stefanie Pillai and Ashley Greig
59,Australian English,"Australian English must be counted among the ""settler"" varieties of the English-speaking world, transported by convicts and immigrants, and quickly established as the official language of the under-inhabited ""Great South Land"". English was brought to Australia in 1788 by people who came from all over England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Migration from the British Isles has continued from the earliest days and these migrants have been joined by others, initially from northern Europe, and since the 1950s from southern Europe and the Middle East, and in more recent times from Asia. In order to describe the range of variation in pronunciation, a distinction is usually made between Broad, General and Cultivated Australian English. Although it is certainly the case that regional and social variation exists, the differences in pronunciation are often quantitative rather than qualitative and much more subtle than those in the British Isles or North America.",Peter Collins and Pam Peters
60,Australian Vernacular English,"Australian Vernacular English is a variety which can be heard in the conversational speech of some Australians, especially working class and country men. It is characterised by the frequent occurrence of certain phonological and grammatical features that are rare or absent in more standard varieties. Some Australians consistently use the full range of Australian Vernacular English features in conversation while others use only part of the range. The strongest input into this speech tradition appears to have come from the dialects of southeast England, especially London Cockney. Australian Vernacular English may be contrasted with two other mainstream varieties of Australian English: Standard Australian Colloquial English and Standard Australian Formal English. Although Australian Vernacular English is arguably an endangered language ‚Äì its basilectal speakers make up a diminishing proportion of the total population ‚Äì it is likely to remain strong in places where men gather to do manual work, play sports or socialise. Andrew Pawley ºs Handbook chapter (Pawley 2008) is mainly based on data from Tasmania.",Andrew Pawley
61,Aboriginal English,"Aboriginal English is one of the three major varieties of restructured English currently spoken by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Aboriginal English, with some regional variation, is spoken in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities throughout Australia. It developed in different parts of the country from pre-existing pidgins of which one, New South Wales Pidgin, was dominant. It also underwent ongoing influence from standard and non-standard varieties of English spoken in Australia and in some places from creoles, some of which are still spoken in northern areas. In Aboriginal English there are traces of innovative processes in the morphology and syntax which are a part of the developmental continuum away from English, but also evidence of the restructuring continuum under the influence of Standard English.",Ian Malcolm
62,Roper River Creole (Kriol),"The indigenous population of Australia first came into more or less intensive contact with English speakers in 1788 when the British occupied the area around Port Jackson in New South Wales. As a result, a pidgin developed which was also used as a lingua franca for indigenous-based communication along traditional trade routes. This pidgin also expanded into the Northern Territory where, at the beginning of the 20th century, it began to creolise into RRC (or Kriol as it is also called since 1976) in the context of an Anglican Church mission where a generation of children adopted the pidgin as their first language. An orthography was developed and by the mid-20th century RRC had come to displace an increasing number of indigenous languages. Today it is spoken by at least 20,000 people.",Ian Malcolm
63,Torres Strait Creole,"Torres Strait Creole belongs to the varieties of restructured English spoken in Australia. The variety arose in the Torres Strait Islands, following the arrival of large numbers of Europeans, South Sea Islanders, Papua New Guineans and others. Pacific Pidgin English came to be used as a lingua franca and started to creolise by the 1890s. The creole then spread throughout the islands, not only because it was useful but also because many considered it to be English. Today Torres Strait Creole is spoken in the Torres Strait Islands between Cape York and Papua New Guinea, and along the north coast of the Queensland mainland. It has around 3,000 native speakers and up to 12,000 second language speakers.",Ian Malcolm
64,New Zealand English,"New Zealand is situated over 1,500 km SE of Australia, but was largely settled via Australia and was for some years administered by the British from Australia. Also, New Zealand was settled largely by people from Britain (as was Australia), although the mixture of individuals was of course different. Under such circumstances, it is perhaps not surprising that there are similarities between the way English is pronounced in Australia and New Zealand, but there are also differences. In describing the pronunciation of English in New Zealand, we draw attention to differences with Australian pronunciation, and the variation that is found within New Zealand English.",Heidi Quinn
65,Norfolk Island/ Pitcairn English,"Pitcairn Island is situated in an isolated part of the Central South Pacific Ocean (24¬∞ 01 ºS. x 130¬∞ 06 ºW). Its landmass is less than five square kilometres and its present population around 50, with a possibility that it will be abandoned. Norfolk Island is located 1,575 kilometres east of Australia in the South Pacific Ocean (24¬∞ 05 ºS x 167¬∞ 59E). It occupies an area of 34.6 square kilometres and has a permanent population of about 2,600. Both Pitkern and Norfuk have always been spoken side by side with acrolectal varieties of English (British and Australian on Norfolk, British and American on Pitcairn). Code mixing is pervasive; there are virtually no examples, even from older conservative speakers, which do not involve code-switching. At present, the Norfolk Islanders are in the process of deciding on questions such as language name, lexical and grammatical norms, writing system and social role.",Peter M√ºhlh√§usler
66,Palmerston English,"PE is spoken by just over 50 people on a remote atoll of the Cook Islands in the South Pacific. In 1863, the Englishman William Ma(r)sters settled on Palmerston with several Polynesian women from the Northern Group of the Cook Islands.  Marsters ruled the island in an autocratic style: only English was allowed to be spoken and it is recorded that the children from his various wives spoke English with a strong British accent. The perpetuation of the speech was more difficult for the women than for the men because they did not have a direct female example from Britain to imitate. The three branches of the family are now in their 8th generation and their offspring live mainly in Rarotonga, Aitutaki, New Zealand and Australia (several thousand people, with a varying degree of competence in the language, depending on the contact retained with Palmerston).",Sabine Ehrhart and Rachel Hendery
67,Acrolectal Fiji English,"The Republic of the Fiji Islands comprises some 330 islands in the southern Pacific Ocean and straddles the International Date Line. Fijian chiefs ceded the country to Britain in 1874, and soon after, indentured labourers from India were brought to work on plantations. Today, the population of just over three quarters of a million include a little over 50% indigenous Fijians, over 40% Indo-Fijians, and small groups of Rotumans, Chinese, other Pacific islanders, part-Europeans, and Europeans. The three main languages spoken are Fijian, Fiji Hindi, and English. English, important since colonial times, has seen its role increase in the lives of many Fiji Islanders, particularly since independence in 1970. Although the 1997 Constitution accords equal status to the three main languages, English prevails in most official spheres - government, education, business, the judiciary, and the media. English is also used widely as a lingua franca, although there is also a substantial amount of vernacular bilingualism. The local variety of English, known as Fiji English, reflects the linguistic backgrounds of its diverse speakers while at the same time sharing features with other Englishes. (Abbreviations: Fj = Fijian, IFj = Indo-Fijian, FjC = Fijian-Chinese).",Marianne Hundt and Carolin Biewer and Lena Zipp
68,Pure Fiji English (basilectal FijiE),"Fiji is a group of over 300 islands in the southern Pacific Ocean and was first settled about 3,000 years ago by speakers of Austronesian languages. More intensive contact with Europeans started in the 1830s, after the arrival of missionaries. In 1874 Fiji became a British colony. Today, the overall population of 800,000 comprises 51% indigenous Fijians and 44% Indo-Fijians (the descendants of indentured labourers brought from India). During colonial times, English was established as a neutral lingua franca, remained an official language after independence in 1970, and still prevails in most official spheres. Nearly all Fiji Islanders speak English as a second language, only 1% to 3% of the population speak it as their first language. Pure Fiji English, the variety most removed from the norm, is noticeably influenced by the first languages of its speakers, Fijian and Hindi, especially in the domain of phonology.",Jan Tent
69,Bislama,"Bislama is an English-lexifier radically restructured contact language spoken in Vanuatu in the southwest Pacific which initially developed as a distinct variety over about half a century between the mid-1800s and the end of the nineteenth century. Soon after the establishment of the British colony of New South Wales in 1788, a pidgin developed which was used between settlers and Aboriginal peoples along the ever-expanding frontier. Features of this pidgin made their way into what has often been referred to as South Seas Jargon, which was spoken by ships‚Äô crews and individuals on shore in a wide variety of locations around the Pacific islands in the early 1800s.",Miriam Meyerhoff
70,Tok Pisin,"Tok Pisin developed as an English-based contact language in the Pacific from the mid-19th century onwards. Although its origins are firmly rooted in Pacific Pidgin English, its development is somewhat different from its sister dialects. Isolation from other south-west Pacific varieties led to considerable influence from the Austronesian languages of New Britain and New Ireland, especially in the lexicon, but also in grammatical structures. Although the name ""Pidgin"" is frequently used to refer to the language, Tok Pisin is spoken by an increasing number of children as a first language, i.e. as a Creole. The term Tok Pisin, then, refers to a complex of first and second language varieties. These are spoken with varying degree of fluency, and are influenced to a varying extent by other languages used.",Geoff Smith
71,Hawai ºi Creole,"Hawaii Creole is a creole language lexified predominantly by English but also by other languages such as Hawaiian and Japanese. Hawaii Creole is spoken by an estimated 600,000 people in the US state of Hawai ºi. In the linguistics literature, it is usually called Hawai ºi (or Hawaiian) Creole English, but its speakers call it ""Pidgin"". While Hawaii Creole uses many words from Hawaiian and other languages, the majority of its vocabulary comes from English. The phonology and semantics, however are quite different from English. The morphology and syntax of Hawaii Creole, too, are quite distinct from English. In general, like other Creole languages, the amount of bound morphology is less than that of the lexifier language and there are quite different morphosyntactic rules for expressing tense, aspect, modality and negation, as well as for relativisation, complementation and focusing. The situation is complicated by the fact that the majority of speakers of Hawaii Creole also know English, and there is a continuum from heavy varieties furthest from Standard English (the basilect) to light varieties closest to Standard English (the acrolect), with a great deal of variation in between (the mesolects).",Kent Sakoda and Jeff Siegel
72,Falkland Islands English,"Falkland Islands English is spoken by the roughly 3000 residents of the Falkland Islands, an Overseas Territory of the UK located east of Argentina in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. It developed from the mid-19th century onwards as a result of migration largely from the South-West of England and from Scotland. Whilst dialect contact has played a major role in the evolution of the variety, language contact has been much less significant: most migrants were Anglophone, and they came into contact with no indigenous population on arrival. The result is a highly levelled variety typologically similar to Southern varieties of English in England, and with the only evidence of language contact coming in the form of minimal lexical borrowing from Spanish.",David Britain and Andrea Sudbury
73,St. Helena English,"St Helena is a rather isolated island in the mid-central South Atlantic Ocean. The population today is about 4,000, with most of them living in the island‚Äôs capital Jamestown. The beginnings of the continuous native-speaker tradition of StHE lie in the mid 17th century, making it the oldest variety of Southern Hemisphere English. Its founding populations were socially and ethnically diverse. Most of the early British working-class settlers came from southern England, large numbers of slaves were later imported from the west African coast, India and Madagascar. StHE evolved in a setting of ethnic mixing and sociodemographic homogenization and was accompanied by language shift, dialect levelling and bilingualism.",Daniel Schreier
74,Tristan da Cunha English,"Tristan da Cunha is an isolated island in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean, about 2,300 km south of St. Helena. The island can only be reached by ship on eight to ten occasions a year. With only about 280 speakers, TdCE is by far the smallest variety of English around the world. TdCE is unusual for a number of other reasons as well. It developed in the 1820s and thus belongs to the youngest L1 varieties of English. Settlers came from Britain, the northeastern US, South Africa and St Helena. There has never been any language contact as the island was uninhabited prior to 1816, and the speech community is entirely anglophone and monolingual. Today, the population is stable and there is practically no out-migration.",Daniel Schreier
75,Philippine English,"Philippine English is one of the very few American-transplanted Englishes. The language was introduced in the country by American colonization that started in 1898. From only 300,000 users or 4% of the population at the beginning of the 20th century, it is estimated that there were around 42 million or 70% of the population who are able to use English, almost fifty years after the American colonization ended at the end of the century (Gonzalez, 1996). In the implementing 1987 Constitution, English is regarded as one of the two official languages of the Philippines, the other one being the national language Filipino. It also interacts with 180 other Austronesian-type languages used in the country, nine of them considered major languages. English plays a major role in the Philippine society, offering a rightfully unique rendering of the psycho-sociolinguistic phenomenon of the spread of English: A sizeable number of Filipinos even learn it as a first language (and sometimes only language). The language is widely used in government, education, business, science and technology, and the arts but it has also penetrated the personal and private lives of Filipinos, where code-switching can be prevalent. Proficiency in English may also be equated with socio-economic status; those with higher socio-economic status tend to be more proficient in the language. Philippine English is presently entering a stage of structural systematicization (cf. Borlongan & Lim, 2012) and is being codified through dictionaries and grammars. Consequently, some claims are made that Philippine English is already at the phase of endonormative stabilization (Borlongan, 2011).",Ariane Macalinga Borlongan and Joo Hyuk Lim
