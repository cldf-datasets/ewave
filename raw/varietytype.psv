L1t|Traditional L1 varieties|Traditional, regional dialects (non-standard varieties) which are long-established mother tongue varieties and which are characterized by a low degree of contact with other dialects and languages.
L1c|High-contact L1 varieties|As the label suggests, the varieties in this group are characterized by a high degree of contact between different dialects of English and/or between English and other languages. The following three types of varieties are considered high-contact L1 varieties in eWAVE:           <br/>(a)    Transplanted L1 Englishes or colonial (standard) varieties: new indigenized varieties of English with native speakers from early on that have been formed by settlers with diverse linguistic and/or dialectal backgrounds roughly within the last 400 years. These varieties typically emerge in former settlement colonies.           <br/>(b)    Language-shift Englishes: varieties that have replaced the erstwhile primary language in the community and that have adult and child L1 and L2 speakers forming one speech community. These varieties might also have shifted to the extent that they do no longer have significant numbers of L2 speakers.           <br/>(c)    Standard L1 varieties.
L2|Indigenized L2 varieties|Non-native, indigenized varieties that do not have significant numbers of native speakers but may nonetheless have prestige and important normative status in the political communities where they are spoken. These varieties typically emerged in countries where English was introduced in the colonial era in either face-to-face communication or (more usually) via the education system.
P|English-based Pidgins|English-based contact varieties (or rather, contact languages) that typically developed in trade colonies for the purpose of communication between two or more groups of speakers that did not share a common language. Full acquisition of the English language has in most cases not been the target. Initially, pidgins are nobodyâ€™s mother tongue and are usually restricted to certain domains of use (often as lingua francas). However, they may over time acquire native speakers and also enter further domains of use (extended/expanded pidgins). With the exception of Butler English, all the English-based pidgins in eWAVE can be considered expanded pidgins.
Cr|English-based Creoles|English-based contact varieties (or rather: contact languages) that typically developed in settings (often in plantation colonies) where a group of non-English speakers acquired some variety of English. Typically, there was strong pressure upon the non-English speaking group to use the language of the socio-economically superior group (i.e. English), while exposure to its native speakers was normally very limited. In the Caribbean, for example, the proportion of native (and L2) speakers of English was rather low in contrast to non-English speakers (who constantly arrived in the colonies in large numbers). Many creoles have become the native language of the majority of the population.
